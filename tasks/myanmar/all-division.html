        <p class="lead ">Welcome To Myanmar Famous Places!</p>
        <p>Myanmar, the official name for the Southeast Asian nation more commonly known as Burma, is a must-see for travelers who like Buddha and beaches, though not necessarily in that order. The country contains thousands of Buddhist temples. It also has pristine white beaches along the Bay of Bengal and Andaman Sea. The country is slowly opening to foreign tourism, so travelers who want to experience a more traditional Burma may want to visit now. An overview of the top tourist attractions in Myanmar:</p>

                <p>The Dhammayangyi Temple is one of the four major Bagan monuments and ranks alongside Shwezigon Pagoda, Ananda Temple and Thatbyinnyu Temple in importance. Its grandiose architectural plan is similar to Ananda Temple and was built by King Narathu, also known as Kalagya Min, 'the king killed by Indians.’</p> 
                <p>Location: East of Shinbinthalaung and Shwesandaw in the region of Old Bagan.</p>

                    <p>The Gawdawpalin Temple is one of the biggest shrines in Bagan, and the most imposing because of the Buddha images to be found on the ground floor. The building of the two-storey temple was commenced by King Narapatisithu but it was his son who completed the construction. The name of the temple means 'the throne which has worshipped.'</p><p> Location: North of Meemalaung Kyaung in Old Bagan.</p>

                    <p>Like the Shwezigon Pagoda, the Htilominlo Temple can be found in the Nyaung U and Wetkyi-In region of Bagan. The 46-metre, three-storey temple was built in 1218, during the reign of King Nantaungmya. It is said that the name is a misreading of the Pali term for 'Blessings of the Three Worlds.'</p>

                    <p>The Shwezigon Pagoda is considered as Bagan's most significant shrine. It is said that the structure was built to enshrine one of the four replicas of the Buddha’s tooth in Kandy, Sri Lanka. The construction was started by King Anawrahta, but the project was not completed until the rule of King Kyanzittha. </p>
                    <p>Location: Northwest of Kyanzittha Umin near the banks of Irrawaddy River, in the regions of Nyaung U and Wetkyi-In.</p>

                    <p>A visit to Bagan would not be complete without a trip to Mount Popa. Considered as one of the most popular pilgrimage spots in Myanmar, Mount Popa is an extinct volcano where the Popa Taungkalat Monastery is found. Popa used to be called the ‘Mountain of Spirits,’ and is still recognized as a dwelling of 'nats,' or spirits of ancient ancestors.</p>

                <h4>Shwedagon Pagoda</h4>
                <p>Shwedagon is dazzling by day but becomes truly magical by night when the whole place is lit up. Expect no fewer people as streams of devotees still arrive at this hour to worship. The shrine is especially full on Buddhist religious days, which take place almost every month. The terrace tends to get very hot underfoot so avoid visiting during the hottest time of the days. Always dress modestly when visit religious sites in Asia; trousers or knee-length shorts or skirts with elbow-length sleeves are acceptable norm. </p>

                    <p>There are lakeside restaurants serving local food at reasonably prices, but the highpoint of any visit would be Karaweik Hall, the bird-shaped floating restaurant on the eastern side of the lake. This is where you can take in the whole vista of the lake and the Shwedagon Pagoda beyond. Established in the 1980s, Karaweik Hall comprises three floors that include private dining rooms, spaces for traditional performances, shops selling Myanmar art and crafts, and amusement section for children. </p>

                <p>The Maha Myat Muni Pagoda, also known as the Mahamuni Pagoda, is the holiest pilgrimage site in Mandalay. This pagoda houses the Maha Myat Muni Pagoda Buddha image, the most ancient and most revered of all Buddha images.

                    <h4>Mandalay Hill</h4>
                    <p>Almost everyone who visits Mandalay goes to this hill. It is the landmark of Mandalay and also serves as a natural watchtower because it overlooks the city. Visitors often watch the sunrise or sunset over the city plains here because of the stunning views. According to legend, the Lord Buddha visited the hill and made a prophecy that a great city would be established at its foot.</p>

                    <h4>Mandalay Palace</h4>
                    <p>The Myan Nan San Kyaw, or Royal Palace, was the first palace to be built in Mandalay. Constructed by King Mindon, who moved his capital from Amarapura to Mandalay, the location was chosen because of astronomical calculations and favourable omens. The entire palace complex was destroyed by fire during World War II, but it has been restored.</p>

                    <p>This Mandalay attraction is most notable for its resemblance to the Kuthodaw Pagoda, because the Sandamuni also has many slender whitewashed ancillary stupas in its grounds. The Sandamuni Pagoda is best known for the Iron Buddha Sandamuni cast by King Bodawpaya of the Konbaung Dynasty in 1802. The cast was brought from Amarapura to its present location in 1874 by King Mindon.</p>
